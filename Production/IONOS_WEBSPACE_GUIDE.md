   const nextConfig = {
     output: 'export',
     images: {
       unoptimized: true,
     },
   }
   ```

2. **Remove Dynamic Features:**
   - Delete `/app/api/` folder (API routes not supported)
   - Delete `/app/admin/` folder (won't work)
   - Modify pages to use static data only

   npm run build
   ```

4. **Upload to IONOS:**
   - Upload contents of `out/` folder to IONOS webspace

### Files to Upload (Static):
- Everything in `out/` folder
- Images from `public/images/`

## 💡 My Strong Recommendation

**Don't use IONOS Webspace for this project.**

Instead:
1. Deploy to **Vercel (FREE)** ← Best option
2. Or upgrade to **IONOS VPS** (€4/month)
3. Or use **Railway/Netlify** (FREE)

Your D2D platform needs:
- Node.js runtime
- API routes for tours management
- Admin panel functionality
- Dynamic data updates

**All of these require a Node.js server, which IONOS Webspace doesn't provide.**
